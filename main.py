        Selects the feature closest to the center of the cluster. The method returns the feature that has

        This feature is considered the "center" of the cluster because it is, 
        on average, closest (most similar) to the other features in the cluster in terms of correlation.

        *Example*
        Suppose we have a cluster with three features: A, B, and C. 
        The correlation matrix shows the following correlations:

        A B C
        A 1.0 0.8 0.5
        B 0.8 1.0 0.4
        C 0.5 0.4 1.0
        
        For feature A: Average correlation = mean(|0.8|, |0.5|) = 0.65
        For feature B: Average correlation = mean(|0.8|, |0.4|) = 0.6
        For feature C: Average correlation = mean(|0.5|, |0.4|) = 0.45
        Here, feature C has the lowest average correlation with the other features,
